# Technologies
- Database: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- Backend: [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
- Frontend Components: [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- Frontend State: [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- Cloud Storage: [Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

Scribbblez backend utilizes Ruby on Rails web application framework and PostgreSQL, storing user's account information and querying data. I used Jbuilder to send JSON objects from my backend to the frontend. I used React.js with Redux for state managment and building user interfaces. I also used React-router and Jquery for routing and interacting with backend. I used Amazon Web Services S3 cloud storage for image hosting.
